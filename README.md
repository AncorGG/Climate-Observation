# Climate Observation

XML Schema validation of a climate observation xml

## About App

This App would be usefull for climate observant enthusiants who are passioned to spread a Daily observation of their surroundings. User's may be able to add their report which is saved and evaluated in an xml file.

## How It Works

The user may add information using a form on the App filling the main fields ( key, reference, scale and units, value, width ) the other information ( code, index ) will be automatically filled by the app. Once submited, the information will be composed as a new <'element'> and added at the end of the file insed the <'messages'> tab.

### Validation

Lets check how the validation occurs

Elements may be composed in one of these three ways

Key elements may only be composed of a key and a value

The Extended elements can have the value with the 'null' atributte but in either case it always has to exist.
